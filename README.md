I am a rising Senior at the University of South Carolina, working toward a B.S. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. I currently work as an undergraduate research assistant with the Valar Group, where I am working on applications of machine learning and Android Wear OS development in human activity recognition. 

Overall, I have a strong interest in new software development and machine learning technologies and how they can be used to solve real-world problems, especially in fields of medicine. After graduation, I plan to complete an accelerated masterâ€™s degree in computer science before transitioning to the data science or application development industry.
